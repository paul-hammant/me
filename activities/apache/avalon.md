In my hobby time, I was a patron and enthusiastic donor of code to Apache's ground-breaking Inversion of Control (IoC) "Avalon" technology for Java applications. Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Avalon 

My own Avalon using projects inclued Jesktop - a desktop OS-alike layer for Java. Refs: http://jesktop.sf.net/ and http://jesktopapps.sf.net/

This was between 2001 and 2005. By the time of Avalon's closure as a project, I had become a pioneer of the related Dependency Injection (DI) with PicoContainer elsewhere. Ref: http://picocontainer.com/
